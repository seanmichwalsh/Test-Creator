Suppose the method int sign(int x) returns 1 if x is positive, -1 if x is negative, and 0 if x is 0. Given
    int[] nums = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2};
What are the values of the elements of nums after the following code is executed?
    for (int k=0; k<nums.length; k++)
    {
      nums[k] -= sign(nums[k]);
      nums[k] += sign(nums[k]);
    }

-2, 0, 0, 0, 2


-2, -1, 0, 1, 2

-1, 0, 0, 0, 1

0, 0 , 0, 0, 0

Consider the following code segment:
    String[][] m = new String[6][3];
    for (int k = 0; k <m.length; k++)
    {
      m[k][m[0].length-1] = “*”;
    }
Which of the following best describes the result when this code segment is executed?

All elements in the last column of m are set to “*”

All elements in the first row of m are set to “*”

All elements in the last row of m are set to “*”

The code has no effect
